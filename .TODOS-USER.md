# User TODOs

## Setup Tasks

### 1. Create Google Ads Test MCC Account
- [ ] Create a test Google Ads Manager Account (MCC) for development and testing
  - Visit: https://ads.google.com/home/tools/manager-accounts/
  - Sign up for a Manager Account (it's free)
  - This will allow you to:
    - Create test client accounts under the MCC
    - Test the GAQL query builder without affecting real campaigns
    - Generate API credentials for development
- [ ] After creating the MCC account:
  - [ ] Create at least one test client account under the MCC
  - [ ] Generate OAuth2 credentials for API access
  - [ ] Store credentials securely (never commit them to the repository)
  - [ ] Consider using Google Ads API test accounts for development: https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/start

### 2. API Access Setup
- [ ] Enable Google Ads API access for your MCC account
- [ ] Obtain a Developer Token (required for API access)
  - Apply here: https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/get-started/dev-token
- [ ] Configure authentication following Google's OAuth2 flow
- [ ] Set up environment variables for API credentials

## Development Environment
- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Set up linting configurations (pending @trafficbyintent/style-guide availability)
- [ ] Configure TypeScript paths and aliases as needed
- [ ] Set up testing environment with Vitest

## Documentation Review
- [ ] Review the generated resource documentation in `/docs/resources/`
- [ ] Verify accuracy against your Google Ads API usage patterns
- [ ] Note any resources that need additional examples or clarification

## Notes
- The test MCC account is essential for safe development and testing
- Never use production Google Ads accounts for testing
- Keep all credentials out of version control
- Consider using Google's test account features for unit testing
